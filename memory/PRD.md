# Divine Iris Healing - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a pixel-perfect clone of https://divineirishealing.com/ with comprehensive admin panel, robust enrollment system with anti-fraud India-gating, custom duration tiers, promotions/coupon system, geo-currency detection, and multi-program cart system.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Pydantic + Motor (async MongoDB)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Payments**: Stripe (TEST MODE) via emergentintegrations
- **Email**: Resend (configured, pending domain verification)

## What's Been Implemented

### Stripe Payment Fix (COMPLETED - Mar 11, 2026)
- [x] **"Invalid price" bug fixed** — checkout now passes tier_index + client_currency to server-side pricing
- [x] **Duration tier pricing** flows correctly through enrollment → OTP → Stripe checkout
- [x] **Multi-currency support** — Stripe receives correct amount in detected currency (USD/AED/INR)

### UID System, Referral, Cart Discount Fix, 32 Countries (COMPLETED - Mar 12, 2026)
- [x] **UID System** — Auto-generated `DIH-{PROGRAM}-{INITIALS}-{SEQ}` format (e.g., DIH-AWRP-JD-0001) using MongoDB counter. Generated on payment confirmation, shown on success page and email
- [x] **Cart Discount Bug Fixed** — CartContext now stores offer prices; CartPage/CartCheckoutPage show strikethrough for discounted items
- [x] **32 Country Codes** — Added 15 more countries (Nepal, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, New Zealand)
- [x] **Referral Toggle** — "Referred by a Divine Iris member" checkbox + referrer name field on enrollment and cart pages
- [x] **Backend Offer Price Fix** — Stripe checkout now uses offer_price_{currency} when > 0 for all currencies including AED

### Bug Fixes — Mar 12, 2026
- [x] **Image Upload Fixed** — Rewrote ImageUploader with proper drag-and-drop support (onDrop, onDragOver handlers) and click-to-upload via hidden file input ref
- [x] **Phone/WhatsApp Country Codes** — Added mandatory country code dropdown (+91, +971, +1, etc.) before phone and WhatsApp fields in both Enrollment and Cart pages, with 10-digit limit
- [x] **Strike-off Prices Fixed** — Added `offer_price_aed` to backend model, fixed admin "Offer AED" column (was saving to wrong field), fixed CurrencyContext to return AED offers for non-flagship programs

### Post-Payment Links & Participant Insights (COMPLETED - Mar 11, 2026)
- [x] **Program Links in Admin Panel** — WhatsApp Group, Zoom Meeting, Custom Link fields with toggle switches in program form

- [x] **Enhanced Payment Success Page** — Full receipt with participants list, amounts, booker info, and program links
- [x] **Enhanced Confirmation Email** — Includes participant table with first-time status, program links as CTA buttons
